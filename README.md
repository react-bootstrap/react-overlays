Utilities for creating robust overlay components.

## Documentation

https://react-bootstrap.github.io/react-overlays

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-overlays
```

## Notes

All of these utilities have been abstracted out of [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) in order to provide better access to the generic implementations of these commonly-needed components. The included components are building blocks for creating more polished components. Everything is bring-your-own-styles, CSS or otherwise.

If you are looking for more complete overlays, modals, or tooltips – something you can use out-of-the-box – check out React-Bootstrap, which is built using these components.
